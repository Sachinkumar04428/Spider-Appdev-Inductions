## Rocket Raccoon :)

Rocket Raccoon is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is an intelligent, anthropomorphic raccoon, who is an expert marksman, weapon specialist and master tactician. 
***That was copied from Wikipedia***

His character has developed a over the ***Guardians movies***. He is awesome at cracking jokes. He played a very significant role in the Avengers Infinity war and Endgame. In Infinity war, he assisted Thor to get Stormbreaker.
 
In Endgame... he was the one who got the Reality Stone...hell yeah!
Thor and Rocket have to head to Asgard in 2013 to retrieve the Reality Stone, you know the story. So, When Thor is struggling to cope with being back on Asgard, after having seen it destroyed, Rocket must carry out the mission on his own, and get the stone from Jane's body.

That is one out of the 6 infinity stone, great contribution.
